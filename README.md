# US Visa Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict the approval of US visa applications using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features related to visa applications. 

## Problem Statement

Given certain features of a visa application, the goal is to predict whether the application will be approved or not. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is `approved` (1 for approved, 0 for not approved).

## Solution Scope

This can be used in real life by visa processing agencies to automate the initial screening of applications, thereby improving efficiency and reducing manual workload. Also US visa applicants can use this model to get an idea of their chances of approval based on historical data, so that they could improve their applications accordingly.

## Solution Proposal

We will build a machine learning model using the following steps:
1. **Load the dataset**: Import the necessary libraries and load the dataset.   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary, and select the most relevant features for the model.
5. **Model Building**: Split the data into training and testing sets, and build a machine learning model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest, etc.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
